# Deep-Learning-Algorithms
Deep learning algorithms are a subset of machine learning algorithms that are specifically designed to process and learn from complex, high-dimensional data. These algorithms are based on artificial neural networks, which are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.

## Abstract: 

This talk will explore the fusion of physics informed neural networks and differential equations in the pursuit of numerical solutions to nonlinear of partial differential equation (PDE). We delve into the architecture of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), discussing their integration of known physics into the learning process. Through case studies and applications, we illustrate the efficacy of PINNs in diverse domains and highlight their potential to revolutionize computational modeling.
